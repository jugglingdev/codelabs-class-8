## Pricing Calculator

In this project, I made a simple pricing calculator using form inputs for price and quantity.  Once the HTML was ready, I used JavaScript to grab the elements, add event listeners, and write functions that would execute upon interaction with the elements.  As the price and quantity are adjusted, the total cost changes.
